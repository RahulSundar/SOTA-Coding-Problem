I recently came across a State of the Art (SOTA) problem according to me. How I define a problem to be really good-

* While reading the problem it seems to be very easy
* It becomes hard while you try and code it (By logic and not by knowledge of coding)
* The optimal solution is just a few lines of code

I explain how I solved this kind of problem and how you could approach it.
